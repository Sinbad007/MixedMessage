# READM ME MIXED MESSAGE #

## I. Project Title ## 
Mixed Message for Words of encouragement

##II. Description##

This application generates random worker names, tasks and speed performance for a job.
Performance based on this speed value, the application will provide words of encouragement for the results that have been given (supervisor role - spv), and words to always improve performance (human resource role - hr)

The purpose of making this project is for practice at the code academy. I hope this project can be developed into a more useful program in the future.
Meanwhile, the aim of this application is to help improve employee performance with words that build and encourage performance.

**Note : Speed 1 ( poor ) ~ Speed 5 ( best ).**
